# Plurality-Test
A project made to answer the question, "If _m_ candidates run in an election in which n voters each vote for 1 candidate, how can we be
confident that the leading candidate has a statistically significant plurality of the votes?" In the PDF file, I construct a hypothesis test, which I call the plurality test, to answer this question and describe simulated critical values for various combinations of values for m and n at a 95% confidence level.

plurality_test.java contains the code used to perform the simulations.
plurality_test.R contains the code used to create Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 4.
